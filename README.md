This project is an internet speed checker that uses JavaScript to calculate the speed of a user's internet connection. The speed is calculated in bits per second (bps), kilobits per second (Kbps), and megabits per second (Mbps).

Features

Calculates internet speed in kilobits per second (Kbps)
Calculates internet speed in megabits per second (Mbps)
How it works

The internet speed checker works by fetching an image from an image URL and measuring the time it takes to load the image. The size of the image is also retrieved and used to calculate the speed of the internet connection. The speed is then displayed on the screen in bps, Kbps, and Mbps.
